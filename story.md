Sunlite, a long time staple of the Detroit Lakes community, features a full service restaurant and bar as well as a small grocery store that is open year round.

We provide boat access for all of the Floyd Lakes, and customers can enjoy a lakeside meal on the restaurant's deck during the summer.

Positioned on the Richwood North snowmobile trail, Sunlite offers a full menu of hot toddies in the winter. 

We take great pride in being a family friendly restaurant and bar with affordable pricing. We have something for everyone -- indoor and outdoor seating, big screen TVs, bubble hockey, pool tables and other games, candy, ice cream treats, lake access, and snowmobile access.

We are known for our fun and energetic staff, fresh hand pattied beef burgers, and unique offerings of elk, bison, and veggie burgers.
